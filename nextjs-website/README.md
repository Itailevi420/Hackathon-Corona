## Set Up
### Next.JS
If you didn't do so yet, clone the hackathon's repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderfloyd/Hackathon-Corona.git
```
And then
```bash
cd Hackathon-Corona/nextjs-website
npm install
```

### Contentful CMS
1. Go to [Contentful's website](https://www.contentful.com/). Click the _Get Started_ button, make sure you're on the _I Build Software_ tab, click _Try For Free_ and then sign up.
2. Create a new _Space_. You should be able to find the button in the menu on the left. Call it whatever you like.
3. On the top bar, click on the _Content model_ tab, and then click _Add content type_ on the right.
4. Name your content type _Blog Post_ and click _Create_.
5. Then, on the left you'll see a _Add field_ button. You'll have to choose a field type, and maybe some other options. Add 3 fields to the Blog Post content type:
    - Choose _Text_, then _Short text_, and name it `Title`.
    - Choose _Text_, then _Long text_, and name it `Excerpt`.
    - Choose _Text_, then _Long text_, and name it `Post Text`.
6. Click _Save_.
7. Open the project folder in your favorite IDE, and open the `next.config.example.js` file. Fill in all the fields:
    - Find `spaceId` in your space's _Settings_ => _General_.
    - Find your `accessToken` in _Settings_ => _API keys_. You can use the example key generated by Conetntful or generate your own. Note that you are copying the _Content Delivery API - access token_.
    - Find your `environmentId` under _Settings_ => _Environments_.
8. Remove the `example` suffix from the config file name. _The file should be ignored by `.gitignore`_.

__That's it! you should be up and running. To run the dev server__:
```bash
npm run dev
```
